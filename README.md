# Heart_disease_prediction
In this machine learning project, I have collected the dataset from Kaggle  and I will be using Machine Learning to make predictions on whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.


Imported all the Machine Learning algorithms I will be using.
1. K Neighbors Classifier
2. Support Vector Classifier
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier

#Conclusion
In this project, I used Machine Learning to predict whether a person is suffering from a heart disease. After importing the data, I analysed it using plots. Then, I did generated dummy variables for categorical features and scaled other features. 
I then applied four Machine Learning algorithms, `K Neighbors Classifier`, `Support Vector Classifier`, `Decision Tree Classifier` and `Random Forest Classifier`. I varied parameters across each model to improve their scores.
In the end, `K Neighbors Classifier` achieved the highest score of `87%` with `8 nearest neighbors`.
